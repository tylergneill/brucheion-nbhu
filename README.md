This is a copy of [https://github.com/vedicsociety/brucheion](https://github.com/vedicsociety/brucheion), itself a snapshot of [https://github.com/Brucheion/Brucheion](https://github.com/Brucheion/Brucheion). Once the Vedic Society team got a version of the main branch working on Heroku, I copied the idea and deployed my own version at a more specific URL ([http://brucheion-nbhu.herokuapp.com](http://brucheion-nbhu.herokuapp.com)) and containing my Sanskrit dissertation material data (Nyāyabhūṣaṇa 104–154) so that people can get an idea of how Brucheion has been used so far.

I also made a [fork of Brucheion with a few changes I preferred](https://github.com/tylergneill/Brucheion_tgn). My intention is to eventually incorporate my preferred changes in the fork (e.g., projects, automatic manuscript line numbers) into my live Heroku version. If I can ever get rights to display the manuscript images, I would like to do that, too.
