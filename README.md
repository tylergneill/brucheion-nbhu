This is a copy of [https://github.com/vedicsociety/brucheion](https://github.com/vedicsociety/brucheion), itself a snapshot of [https://github.com/Brucheion/Brucheion](https://github.com/Brucheion/Brucheion). Once the Vedic Society team got a version of the main branch working on Heroku, I copied the idea and deployed my own version at a more specific URL ([http://brucheion-nbhu.herokuapp.com](http://brucheion-nbhu.herokuapp.com)) and containing my Sanskrit dissertation material data (Nyāyabhūṣaṇa 104–154) so that people can get an idea of one way Brucheion has been used so far.

To use, after you click on the above link and see the landing page, login using the name "nbhuAvayavin", then use the following URL to get started: [multicompare: CrE:104,6;1](http://brucheion-nbhu.herokuapp.com/multicompare/urn:cts:sktlit:skt0001.nyaya006.CrE:104,6;1/). (One bug to know about: If the server restarts and the program is still logged in, there will be a cookie problem. Deleting the site data, e.g. here for Heroku, should fix the problem. If not, please let me know.)

I also made a [fork of Brucheion with a few changes I preferred](https://github.com/tylergneill/Brucheion_tgn). My intention is to eventually incorporate my preferred changes in the fork (e.g., projects, automatic manuscript line numbers) into my live Heroku version. If I can ever get rights to display the manuscript images, I would like to do that, too.
